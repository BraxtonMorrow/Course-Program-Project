# CS-300-Final
Reads input file into vector formatted output with UI

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
The main overarching problem in each of the assignments was that we had an input of data either bids for an acution or classes for a college, needed to sort it through some sort of data structure and then have an output, with some sort of user interface.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
Well typically when choosing a data structure for something you want to know how it's going to be accessed, how often it's going to be accessed and why it's going to be accessed. For this project in particular I chose using a Vector to store my data becuase I figured it would be the easiest to impliment with the amount of data we had. Our input file was only about 7 or 8 lines, and I didn't think that required instantaneous lookup via a hash table, and using a binary tree would have been absolute overkill. In our bids assignment using a Binary Tree was very optimal as we had several hundred data inputs.
**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
I have several friends that are currently professional programers, and one was a teacher for a bit. If I ever have any questions I am lucky enough to have the rescourses to reach out to people outside of school. Typically first however I will try to either figure out a solution myself, or look through the 'ol Google.
**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
Well currently I'm working on a discord bot in node .js using Vectors to store player data and turn it into a leaderboard format for a Competative Gaming Discord. So I guess I would say it has helped me understand the real world impliacations more of what I can accomplish with code, and the fact that I can turn it into something that excites me.
**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
I have a better understanding of how readable code is very important, and since I'm almost never going to be writing one piece of code from start to finish if I work for a larger corporation, it is very important that my code be as modular as possible. Or as one of my friends likes to put it "Perfect Code". Or more precisely, something that can be called an infinite number of times and only do what it is supposed to in an isloated bubble, to ensure no bugs are caused.
